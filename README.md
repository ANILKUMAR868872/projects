BACKGROUND_REMOVAL OF AN IMAGE:

  To remove the background of an image using Python firstly we have to import the required modules which we have installed using 
  the pip command. Defining two variables “input_path” and “output_path” where input_path stores the path of image of which 
  background to be removed and output_path stores the path where a new image with removed background has to be saved. Now open the 
  image using Image.open() function and then remove the background of the image using the remove() function. In the last step save 
  the processed image at the location stored in output_path using output.save() function.
