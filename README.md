BACKGROUND_REMOVAL OF AN IMAGE MINI PROJECT:
 
  The Miniproject is to remove the background of an image using Python.Firstly we have to import the required modules which we 
  have installed using the pip command. Defining two variables “input_path” and “output_path” where input_path stores the path of 
  image of which background to be removed and output_path stores the path where a new image with removed background has to be 
  saved. Now open the image using Image.open() function and then remove the background of the image using the remove() function. 
  In the last step save the processed image at the location stored in output_path using output.save() function.

  be selecting their respective two signs which are generally used in the game that is, X and O. The two players draw the X and O 
  on an alternative basis on the 3x3 grid having 9 empty boxes as shown below.The game is played by drawing X and O in each box
